### Will using RuneLite get me banned?
No.

### How often is RuneLite updated?
If you're using the launcher, count on seeing updates every week on Thursday. These Thursday releases are done after the game has updated, and can take a few hours if there has been an engine change in the game.

### What is open source?
RuneLite being open source means that the code can be inspected by anybody.
Changes to our software, that anyone can submit, are passed through an audit and acceptance process, where we make sure that the changes don't contain any malicious or rule-breaking code. This makes sure that you won't be running such code.
